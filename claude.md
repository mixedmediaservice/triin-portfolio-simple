# CLAUDE.md ‚Äì Transition Instructions for Existing Project

This project was started in an older Claude web session and may contain redundant or outdated code. Now we are finishing it using Claude Desktop + VS Code plugins.

## ‚úÖ Goals
1. **Review & Sync Context:** 
   - Read all current files and reconcile any inconsistencies from earlier iterations.

2. **Clean Up & Optimize:**
   - Identify and remove redundant, conflicting, or unused code.
   - Consolidate styles, functions, and components for clarity.

3. **Baseline Summary:**
   - Provide a clear, concise summary of the current project state (key files, recent changes, known issues) before major edits.

4. **Resume Best Practices:**
   - After cleanup, switch to the structured workflow from now on:
     - Plan first, work incrementally, label file changes clearly.
     - Edit only what‚Äôs necessary using VS Code diff previews.

*(Do not rewrite working code unnecessarily. Focus on cleanup first, then proceed step by step.)*

## ‚ö° Project Continuity
**ALWAYS read HANDOFF.md first when starting work on this project** - it contains current project state, recent changes, and development guidelines including the auto-compact at 11% rule.
